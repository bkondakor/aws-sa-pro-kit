## Quick Study Paths

### Path 1: Comprehensive Study (8-12 weeks)
1. Start with [[MASTER_STUDY_PLAN|Master Study Plan]]
2. Study each domain in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4)
3. Complete all task materials within each domain
4. Practice with tricky scenarios and questions
5. Complete hands-on labs where available
6. Review service comparisons for confused services
7. Take practice exams

### Path 2: Quick Review (2-4 weeks)
1. Review domain overviews (README files)
2. Focus on tricky scenarios and edge cases
3. Study service comparison matrices
4. Practice questions and exam simulations
5. Review areas of weakness identified in practice

### Path 3: Topic-Based Study
Use Obsidian tags to study by topic across domains:
- `#networking` - Network connectivity across all domains
- `#security` - Security controls and improvements
- `#cost-optimization` - Cost strategies throughout
- `#reliability` - Reliability and resilience patterns
- `#migration` - Migration-specific content

## Study Tips

### For the Exam
1. **Read questions carefully** - Identify key constraints and requirements
2. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Often 2 answers are obviously wrong
3. **Look for AWS best practices** - Choose the "most AWS" answer
4. **Consider operational overhead** - Prefer managed services over DIY
5. **Time management** - ~2.5 minutes per question, flag and move on

### Using These Materials
1. **Use Obsidian graph view** - Visualize connections between topics
2. **Leverage backlinks** - See where concepts are referenced
3. **Search by tags** - Find all content on a specific topic
4. **Create your own notes** - Link to these materials as references
5. **Track progress** - Use checkboxes or tags to mark completed sections

### Effective Study Habits
1. **Hands-on practice** - Set up labs in your own AWS account
2. **Teach others** - Explain concepts to solidify understanding
3. **Real-world application** - Connect concepts to your work
4. **Spaced repetition** - Review materials multiple times over weeks
5. **Practice exams** - Simulate exam conditions regularly
